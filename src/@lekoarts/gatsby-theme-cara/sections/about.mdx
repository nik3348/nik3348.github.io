## About
#
##### My name is Nicholas Lai and I make full stack systems; mobile apps, websites, admin panels.
##### You name it, and I'll get back to you ðŸ˜…
#
I enjoy good company with open minds, my interests range from one physical sport (badminton) to almost any video game.
And when I'm not doing either of those I'm ambitiously learning everything I don't know

I also enjoy building computers; hardware, software I can do both. Please do check out my work in the projects section and hit me up 
at the contact me section
